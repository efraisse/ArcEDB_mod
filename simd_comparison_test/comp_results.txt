16-bit precision comparison operator SIMDArbHCMP
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::invalid_argument'
  what():  Unable to open the file for writing.


Cannot figure out why this doesn't run. Considering it is 
complaining about an invalid argument I will assume this is 
a bug on their end.
